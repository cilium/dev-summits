# Cilium Developer Summits

Cilium Developer Summits are invitation-only developer summits for Cilium OSS committers and experienced code contributors, with a similar format and ethos to the Linux kernel LSF/MM/BPF event. 

This is a technical event, with no more than 30 attendees. Topics are proposed in advance, and start with a short presentation about the problem space and/or idea, followed by open discussion. Submitting a topic is not a requirement to attend.

The event is free to attend but travel and accommodation costs are the responsibility of attendees.

## Selecting attendees

An attendance application form is circulated in the #general channel on eBPF & Cilium Slack, so that interested contributors can register their interest in attending. Acceptance is at the discretion of Cilium maintainers, based on the applicant's history of contributions to the project.
